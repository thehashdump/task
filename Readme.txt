This problem can have multiple solutions. I had a few solutions in mind. It may be possible to solve this problem using 
local storage in the browser. However, since it was a MERN problem, so I thought it would be more appropriate to use 
MERN stack. As components are continuously calling APIs, it is slow (that's its main drawback).
